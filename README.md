# VisualServoingToolbox

Simple Julia package to study Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) systems. It allows to run simulations and plot/animate the resulting trajectories for several kinds of IBVS systems and it is possible to extend it to allow for new, custom systems.

VisualServoingToolbox.jl has been developed mainly for internal use and it will most likely remain in permanent beta. It is released under the [CRAPL license](https://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/).
