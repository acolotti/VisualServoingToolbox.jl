# VisualServoingToolbox

Simple Julia package to study Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) systems. It allows to run simulations and plot/animate the resulting trajectories for several kinds of IBVS controllers.

Here are a couple examples of animations that can be done with it:

One of the aims of the package is also to provide an easy interface to extend it with new, custom systems, even though it is currently undocumented.

VisualServoingToolbox.jl has been developed mainly for internal use and it will most likely remain in permanent beta. It is released under the [CRAPL](https://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/).
